# VSLite_CZnetwork
Data supporting the manuscript using the VS-Lite model to forecast intra-annual growth kinetics and phenology under climate change for temperate forests in Central Europe

### Rscripts 
The key function implementing the VS-Lite model is `RUN.R`. This script can be used to load predefined functions from additional .R files, load the input data, calibrate the model and save the results for the baseline period. To run a model in a forecasting model, use `Forecast_modeling.R`.

### Climatic data
Monthly mean temperature and precipitation totals for each site and the period from January 1961 to December 2020. 

### Climatic projections
Decadal anomalies of mean monthly temperature and precipitation totals with respect to the normal period 1995-2014.
