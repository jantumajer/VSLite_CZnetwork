Data supporting the manuscript using the VS-Lite model to forecast intra-annual growth kinetics and phenology under climate change for temperate forests in Central Europe

**Rscripts** The key function to implement the VS-Lite model is `RUN.R`. This script can be used to load predefined functions from additional .R files, load the input data, calibrate the model and save the results for baseline period. To run a model in a forecasting model, use `Forecast_modeling.R`.
